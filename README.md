# New York City Citi Bike Analysis
## Project overview: 
The following report summarizes the statistical analysis and visualization of bikesharing data for August 2019 of Citi Bike in New York city. The analysis is conducted with the aim to demonstrate the viability of a similar undertaking in Des Moines.

## Results: 
Analysis is summarized in the following visualizations.

1. Customer Information.

## Summary: 

Data demonstrates that bikes sharing is most popular in the morning and late afternoons in downtown Manhattan. This allows us to conclude that bikesharing is popular among commuters given the large proportion of subscribed customers. Furthermore, despite the low proportion of unsubscribed customers, the large number of trips taken by them suggests the popularity of bikesharing among tourists in Manhattan. Data also suggests that bikesharing is more popular among males than females. 

Overall, the analysis of August 2019 bikesharing data in New York warrants the market analysis of Des Moines and suggests the feasibility of a similar undertaking. 

Suggestions for further visulizations: 

1. Visualization of types of customers based on birth year, as demonstrated in image 1 above. 
2. Clients may also benefit from visualization of the number of bikes available in each station and their utilization because iamge 6 above suggests overuse of a few bikes and underuse of too many bikes given the number of total trips.
